# PyProj
# pip install qrcode - use this command in the terminal of your editor to install the library
# Parameters 
# The version parameter is an integer from 1 to 40 that controls the size of the QR Code (the smallest, version 1, is a 21x21 matrix). 
# Set to None and use the fit parameter when making the code to determine this automatically.
# fill_color and back_color can change the background and the painting color of the QR, when using the default image factory. Both parameters accept RGB color tuples.
# The box_size parameter controls how many pixels each “box” of the QR code is.
# The border parameter controls how many boxes thick the border should be (the default is 4, which is the minimum according to the specs).
